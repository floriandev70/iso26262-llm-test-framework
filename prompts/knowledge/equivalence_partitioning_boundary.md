# Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis

## Equivalence Partitioning
- Partition input into valid/invalid classes.
- Each class should be covered by one test case.

## Boundary Value Analysis
- Test values: min-1, min, min+1, nominal, max-1, max, max+1
- Especially useful for ranges and arrays.
